In this assignment we used model 1 proramming with a Degree class and passed information through session objects. We initialized degree information and retrieved it using a degree vector. For address, name, telephone number, residence, and citizenship we stored into the session using the setAttribute and then retrieved the information using getAttribute method. We used basic table html code to present the user information. We obtained information from user using text boxes, drop down, and buttons.
